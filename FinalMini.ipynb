I have used a while loop that will continue looping as long as the sentinel value is not typed in by the user which is 'stop' in this case. Within the while loop is a for loop which will repeat 2 times. The user is asked how hard they would like the riddle to be and their answer is stored in a variable. Depending on their answer, a different branch of the if-then-else staircase is executed. Their answers to the riddles are stored inside variables. Each answer is stored in a different variable. After answering 2 riddles they are asked if they would like to continue to the next part of the game or answer 2 riddles again. If they would like to continue with the rest of the game, then they type anything but the sentinel value. Their answers to the riddles are passed to the next method where they will be checked."
